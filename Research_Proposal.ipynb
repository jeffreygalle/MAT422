        "\n",
        "Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) and cirrhosis are significant public health concerns in the United States, contributing to substantial mortality rates annually. CLD is characterized by long-term deterioration in liver function, often culminating in irreversible damage such as fibrosis and cirrhosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "This research aims to analyze CLD mortality trends and disparities across the U.S., with a particular focus on Arizona. Arizona presents unique challenges, including elevated mortality rates among Native American populations and counties with lower median incomes. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, this project seeks to identify patterns, contributing factors, and actionable insights to reduce the burden of CLD"
